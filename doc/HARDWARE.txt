Inside the HD24

The HD24 is powered by a Motorola Coldfire

QAJ0435)

The Ethernet chip is a CrystalLan CS8900A-CQ3,
a 10Base-T LAN chip.

There is an empty, 26 pin port labelled 'Motorola BDM Port'.
Motorola BDM stands for Motorola Background Debug Module,
so we might speculate that this port allows us to perform
debugging on the HD24 as it is running.

There are to IC41LV16256 chips in the HD24: according to the
data sheets, they are 256kx16 bit Dynamic RAM with EDO page mode,
giving the HD24 a total of 1 megabyte of RAM.

There is an ALTERA ACEX EP1K30QC208-2
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).

There is a Texas Instruments AHCT16541
AHCT16541 devices are noninverting 16-bit
buffers composed of two 8-bit sections with
separate output-enable signals. (possibly 
used for communication to displays?)
