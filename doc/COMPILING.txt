COMPILING HD24TOOLS

Instructions for Linux (preferably Debian/Ubuntu based):

Get the source code from svn on sourceforge.net
(instructions are on sourceforge.net/projects/hd24tools/develop)

sudo apt-get install fluid
sudo apt-get install libjack-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 libsndfile1-dev
sudo apt-get install libxpm-dev
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev libjpeg-dev

NOTE: error "‘PaStreamCallback’ has not been declared" means you've installed portaudio 18 instead of portaudio 19.

Note: You may still need to install libflac.

make clean
./configure
make

mkdir ~/HD24tools
cp hd24connect ~/HD24tools/

ln -s /usr/lib/libjack.so ~/HD24tools/

For HD24tools to detect the drives (when being run as normal user),
normal users need to have sufficient permissions to work with the
drive device.

To find out which drive device it is, run HD24connect as root,
and select File->Recovery->Select device...

This will show you the current device, which is the device
that needs its permissions set.

You can probably gain device permissions by adding your
regular user to the proper group (typically the group called "disk"), 
making your user the
owner of the device or by setting the device permissions
in /etc/fstab.
