Regular vs high sample rates on the HD24
========================================

The HD24 has two operational modes for recording audio; regular sample rates
(44k1, 48k) and high sample rates (88k2, 96k). High sample rate mode is 
achieved by using 2 physical tracks for each logical track. This shows both
in on-drive audio storage and in the way high sample rate audio is presented
on the lightpipe. By interlacing even and odd samples of each logical track
across two physical tracks, backwards ADAT compatibility is achieved.

Meanwhile, songs are still allowed to have the same running time regardless
of sample rate at the cost of some location precision.
At higher sample rates, locate points occur every other sample and the
actual songlength reported also equals the amount of samples divided by 2.
This makes it clear that when dealing with high sample rates, sometimes we
work with actual samples (where a sample is defined as "one measurement")
whereas somethimes we work with sample pairs. In analog to the channels
where an actual on-disk/lightpipe channel is referred to as "physical 
channel" whereas the pair of channels making up a single channel worth of
audio is referred to as "logical channel", we'll also refer to samples
as "physical sample" when we're talking about a single measurement and a
"logical sample" if we're dealing with a possible sample pair.

Here's a breakdown of how the numbers of these two modes compare.
