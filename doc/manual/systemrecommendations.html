<h2>System recommendations</h2>
<p>The HD24tools software should be able to run on almost any system with almost any specification. Most likely, it will work on yours. To find out if it does, give it a try. Should you find that it doesn't, please contact the author so that we can consider making HD24tools work on your system as well.</p>
<p>Requirements for running the software:
<ul><li>Sufficient drive space to hold the software and audio files to be transferred</li><li>
Windows XP or better; MacOS X 10.4 or better; Ubuntu Linux (other distributions may work as well)</li>
<li>Sound card (for audio previews)</li></ul>
</p>
<p>Mixing multitrack audio requires a significant amount of CPU power. If you wish to use HD24connect for audio playback or realtime mixing, you will need a fast processor. See the chapter on mixing for more information on this.</p>
<p>For best performance, it is recommended to connect your HD24 to your computer through a fast interface such as firewire or USB 2.0. Some USB hubs are known to degrade performance; when possible, avoid chaining other devices to the same interface as your HD24 drive. For transfers, a fast interface will simply make the transfers take less time; For realtime mixing and playback, interface speed needs to be sufficient to support uninterrupted streaming. USB 1.0 is known to be too slow for realtime mixing and playback. </p>
<p>HD24tools can be run on Windows Vista. However, Vista requires you to run HD24tools as Administrator to allow the low-level drive access needed by HD24tools*. By default, the administrator account is disabled in Vista; Use your favourite search engine to search for "How to access the true Administrator account in Windows Vista" for more information. 
</p>
<i class=footnote>* There may be a more elegant solution to this problem; Under Linux, similar limitations apply, but these can be bypassed by setting user permissions to allow raw drive access to HD24tools users. It is thinkable that a similar solution can be configured under Vista.</i>
