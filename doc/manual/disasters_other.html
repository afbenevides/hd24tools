<h2>Other disasters</h2>
<p>Although most disaster scenarios are comparable with previously described scenarios, there may be situations where following the general recovery procedure is not enough. You may have projects that stretch beyond the limitations of the <b>longliverec</b> header, or you may need to recover more than the 99 songs offered by the <b>unquickformat</b> header,  or you have a specific scenario which is not covered or solveable by any of the previous scenarios. </p>
<p>In such cases, you can try to create a header file and send it to us for diagnostic purposes. This can be done by menu option </p>
<p><b>File -> Recovery -> Create header file...</b></p>
<p>This will allow the author to take a look at the disk structure, and possibly create a custom header which will allow you to read your disk. A fee may be charged for creating a custom header file. However, it may not always be possible to perform a recovery based on a header file only. Specifically, when it is necessary to reconstruct where and how the audio is stored on disk, the audio itself (and thus the disk) will be needed to allow for a recovery. </p><p>If the disk is required for recovery, or if this whole thing of header files and read-only recoveries is too technical for you, you can send over your drive for recovery. An advance is requested to cover sending costs and diagnosis. Additionally, a (reasonable) fee is charged when recovery is successful. In advance, please contact the author by email for pricing and contact info.</p>
