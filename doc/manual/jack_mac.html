<h2>Using JACK on your Mac</h2>
<p>If you wish to stream audio from HD24tools to other OS/X applications, visit <a href="http://www.jackosx.com">http://www.jackosx.com</a> and download JACK from there. Install the package in the usual manner. The package may require you to reboot your computer.</p>
<p>After the installation is complete, start up HD24connect. In the menu <b>Help -> System Info</b> verify that JACK is loaded.</p>
<p>If it is loaded (which is to be expected), run the JackPilot application and click Start to start up the Jack Server.</p>
<p>If this is the case, click <b>Routing</b> in JackPilot. The Connections Manager will show a list of all JACK-enabled applications. As HD24connect is not playing back audio yet, it will still be missing from this list:</p>

<p>After clicking the <b>STOP</b> button on the recording tab, however, the Connection Manager will in fact show HD24connect as a JACK application:</p>

<p>You can now route JACK audio from HD24connect to other applications as you see fit. If you quit JackPilot and click the <b>Stop</b> button in the recorder again, audio playback will revert to default (CoreAudio).</p>
