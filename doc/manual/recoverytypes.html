<h2>Different types of recovery</h2>
<p>There are different levels of performing a recovery, depending on our needs. In some cases it is enough to simply get our audio back; in other cases, we may want the drive to play in the HD24 recorder again, and if we are yet more demanding we may want to be able to safely record to the recovered drive again.</p><p>As these recoveries are increasingly complex and/or time-consuming, this manual will focus on getting your audio back.</p>
<h3>Read-only recovery</h3>
<p>This manual will focus on read-only recovery, which means we will limit ourselves to reading audio data from disk. By performing a recovery as read-only process, we refrain from making changes to the drive that might do even more damage.</p>
<p>If we wish to create a recovered disk which is readable by a HD24 recorder, after transferring the audio to computer we can use the HD24 recorder itself to write the recovered audio to a new disk (or even format the old one and transfer the data there) by using the write support in HD24tools or the built-in FTP transfer capability of the HD24 recorder.</p>
<p>For the most common types of recovery, the recovery procedure is similar to that of recovering a live performance. Let us examine this general recovery procedure.</p>
