<h2>Using JACK under Windows</h2>
<p>Jack support for Windows has recently become available. To use it with HD24connect, you will need to install <b>jackdmp</b> which can be found on <a href="http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html">http://www.grame.fr/~letz/jackdmp.html</a>. Download a package that contains a binary version and unpack it (with WinZip or similar).</p>
<p>Inside the package, you will find folders <b>bin</b> and jack-[version]. Set up JACK from the <b>bin\windows</b> folder.</p>
<p>Once set up, you will need to make sure that HD24connect can access libjack.dll (possibly named libjackdmp.dll) by copying it to the HD24tools directory and naming it appropriately. To manage connections, you'll want to use the <b>qjackctl.exe</b> program.</p>
