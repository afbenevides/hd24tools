<h2>Finding the HD24 device name</h2>
<p>In some disaster scenarios, the superblock (the first sector
of the HD24 drive) is overwritten or otherwise corrupted.
If this happens, HD24tools will be unable to find the drive
signature that identifies it as HD24 drive, and as such will
be unable to auto-detect the presence of such a drive.</p>
<p><i>Note that an undetected drive does not always indicate
superblock corruption; drive detection may also fail when 
HD24tools does not have sufficient privileges to access
the drive. For example, under Windows Vista and up, this 
may be the case when the program is not run as Administrator.</i> 
To tell the difference, see if the drive is detected by the
HD24 recorder. If a HD24 recorder detects the drive properly 
and HD24tools does not, you are most likely facing a 
permissions problem.</p>
<p>If your HD24 drive is not detected, you may have more
success by manually specifying which drive to use. This 
is done by providing HD24tools with the device name of
the drive to use.</p>
<p>If you choose <b>File->Recovery->Select device...</b>, 
you will see a drop-down box which lists all drives 
that HD24tools has detected in your system. How do we
know which one (if any) is the HD24 drive? The following
pages will help clear this up.</p>
<h3>Quickformat workaround</h3>
<p>Finally, a tip from a HD24tools user: If neither your
PC nor HD24 recognizes the drive as valid HD24 drive, 
you can perform a Quickformat (<b>but absolutely not a 
long format!!</b>) in the HD24 recorder. A quickformat
will write a new superblock to the drive, but but does 
not touch the audio area.<b>Quickformat re-initializes 
the project- and song areas and song allocation information 
on the drive as well. Because of this this workaround is 
NOT RECOMMENDED for drives containing lots of songs, 
as useful recovery information may be lost</b>.
For drives containing a single long live recording, a
quickformat is a possible and realistic workaround, 
when you don't manage to figure out the HD24 device name
using the procedure outlined on the following pages.
