<h2>About the HD24tools software</h2>
<p>The HD24tools software was originally developed to fulfill the need of transferring audio data from FST disks to Linux-based workstations. After fulfilling this need, the software has been extended with some additional features, and ported over to various other operating systems, platforms and architectures. As a result, the HD24tools software will allow you to transfer your audio over almost any connection to almost any computer running almost any operating system.</p><p>The HD24tools software consists of two main programs; one is HD24connect, the other is HD24hexview. Normal users will probably mostly use HD24connect, which is the program that allows transferring audio from HD24 ADAT FST disks.
