<h2>Choosing your hardware</h2>
<p>As HD24tools software works with a variety of hardware, you may want to take a moment to pick the hardware that suits you best.</p>
<ul><li>The Alesis Fireport will work on any computer with a firewire interface, and allows hot-pluggable operation. It will also allow you to use features specific to Alesis' FST/Connect.</li>
<li>If you do not want to get any additional hardware before performing a test drive of the HD24tools software, you can test with a drive image or connect your FST drive directly to the IDE interface of your computer. The drive will need to be jumpered as to MASTER. DO NOT DO THIS if you are uncomfortable swapping around drives.
</li>
<li>If you do not mind swapping drives from HD24 caddies to an external USB bracket, almost any external USB case will do. USB smart cables will also work.</li>
<li>The original Alesis HD24 drive caddies were designed by a company called ViPowER, Inc. You may wish to consider using one of the compatible products that they have manufactured. Depending on your needs, you could use either of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>ViPowER SuperRack model VP-10KFU-133</b><br>
This is an internally mountable drive bay which connects directly to your IDE interface. Fast but NOT hot-swappable. Requires the ADAT drive to be the only drive on the interface. 
</li><li><b>ViPowER SwapRack VP-1028LSF</b><br>An internally mountable drive bay which connects to an external USB interface. Hot-swappable. Requires an available USB port. 
</li>
</ul>
This is a partial list; Information about more models can be found on <a target="_blank" href="http://ringbreak.dnd.utwente.nl/~mrjb/hd24tools/about.html">the HD24tools website</a>. The ViPowER VP-1528LSF drive bay is known to be <u>incompatible</u> with the HD24. 
</li></ul>
<p>In contrast, Alesis' FST/Connect only supports FireWire drives. It will not work with aforementioned USB drive bays.</p>
