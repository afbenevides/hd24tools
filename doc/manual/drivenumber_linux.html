<h2>Finding the HD24 device name (Linux)</h2>
<p>To find the device name under Linux, start up a terminal, then type</p>
<p><pre>ls /dev/sd* /dev/hd*</pre></p>
<p>then press Enter.</p>
<p>This should give you a list of drives, such as:</p>
<p><pre>/dev/sda
/dev/sda1
/dev/sda2
/dev/sda5
/dev/sdb
/dev/sdb1
/dev/sdc</pre></p>
<p>You may also get an error, as it is likely that either one 
of the the /dev/sd.. or /dev/hd.. device groups do not exist. 
You can ignore this error.</p>
<p>How do you know which device is the HD24 drive? A few hints:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>It is usually not <b>/dev/sda</b> or <b>/dev/hda</b> because the first
drive is usually your system drive.</li>
<li>It is not any of the drives where the device name
ends in a number; this is because the numbers indicate 
various partitions on the drive. The HD24 does not support partitions, 
so any disk which is also followed by a number is not an HD24
drive. In the example above, <b>/dev/sda</b> and <b>/dev/sdb</b> are not HD24 drives
because <b>/dev/sda</b> has partitions numbered 1, 2 and 5 and <b>/dev/sdb has</b> a
partition numbered 1.</li>
<li>Finally, it is most likely to be the drive name that
was not listed before connecting the HD24 drive, but that
suddenly shows up when you do connect the HD24 drive to
your computer.</li></ul></p>
<p>In the above case, <b>/dev/sdc</b> is the most likely candidate.</p>
<p>Under <b>File->Recovery->Select device...</b> you should
now specify this device. In the dropdown box <b>Choose device</b>, either select the
device name, or select <b>--Use other device--</b> and manually
enter the device name of the HD24 drive.</p>
