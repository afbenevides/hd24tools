cow_88k2.wav 
	a generic cow sample I found online.

helloworld.wav 
	a 96k sample which was recorded on the HD24 and subsequently
	transferred with HD24tools. Useful for testing transfers as
	transferring this TO an HD24 drive and back again should
 	result in a file which is bit-identical to the original.
